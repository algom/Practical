# Readme for the PML project
This repository contains the R markdown file as well as the html file in which the activity related prediction model for the coursera course is explained.

### Introduction

Devices such as Jawbone and Nike FuelBand, allow to collect data about position in space and time, thus allowing to quantify physical activity and the spatial space where it is conducted. using data from <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>, which collected information of accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants a prediction model was generated in order to classify how barbell lifts were performed correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

The data is composed of two datasets one part for creating and testing the model, and another one with 20 test subjects in which the model should be tested.
